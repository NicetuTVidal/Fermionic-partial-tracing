# Fermionic-partial-tracing
Mathematica functions so you can perform partial tracing on finite fermionic systems without worrying about those nasty - signs. 
The repository includes a Mathematica Notebook file. In this file several functions are included. To generate representations of fermionic density matrices in the canonical basis B and to take the partial trace selecting the desired modes to be taken out. To learn more about the use of the function please read the comments added to the code.  

We cannot guarantee the correct performance of the function. In case of spotting an error or miscalculation, please contact us via email so we can modify the function.
